# QE-CONVERSE
This is the official Git repository of the QE-CONVERSE code for Quantum-Espresso. This
current version is compatible with the version 7.2 of Quantum-Espresso package (QE-7.2).
 

## Features
the QE-CONVERSE implement a non-perturbative approach (converse) to compute the orbital magnetization in isolated and periodic systems. The calculation of orbital magnetization allows ab-initio computation of macroscopic properties like the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts and the Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g tensor.

* NMR shielding tensors
* EPR g-tensor
* It works only with Norm-conserving pseudopotential with GIPAW reconstruction (https://sites.google.com/site/dceresoli/pseudopotentials)
* LDA and GGA functionals
* isolated and periodic systems
